	abstract = {The adult human auditory system can adapt to changes in spectral cues for sound localization. This plasticity was demonstrated by changing the shape of the pinna with earmolds. Previous results indicate that participants regain localization accuracy after several weeks of adaptation and that the adapted state is retained for at least one week without earmolds. No aftereffect was observed after mold removal, but any aftereffect may be too short to be observed when responses are averaged over many trials. This work investigated the lack of aftereffect by analyzing single-trial responses and modifying visual, auditory, and tactile information during the localization task. Results showed that participants localized accurately immediately after mold removal, even at the first stimulus presentation. Knowledge of the stimulus spectrum, tactile information about the absence of the earmolds, and visual feedback were not necessary to localize accurately after adaptation. Part of the adaptation persisted for one month without molds. The results are consistent with the hypothesis of a many-to-one mapping of the spectral cues, in which several spectral profiles are simultaneously associated with one sound location. Additionally, participants with acoustically more informative spectral cues localized sounds more accurately, and larger acoustical disturbances by the molds reduced adaptation success.},

	abstract = {This study examined inter-subject differences in the transfer functions from the free field to the human ear canal, which are commonly know as head-related transfer functions. The directional components of such transfer functions are referred here to as directional transfer functions (DTFs). The DTFs of 45 subjects varied systematically among subjects in regard to the frequencies of spectral features such as peaks and notches. Inter-subject spectral differences in DTFs were quantified between 3.7 and 12.9 kHz for sound-source directions throughout the coordinate sphere. For each pair of subjects, an optimal frequency scale factor aligned spectral features between subjects and, thus, minimized inter-subject spectral differences. Frequency scaling of DTFs reduced spectral differences by a median value of 15.5\% across all pairs of subjects and by more than half in 9.5\% of subject pairs. Optimal scale factors showed a median value of 1.061 and a maximum of 1.38. The optimal scale factor between any pair of subjects correlated highly with the ratios of subjects’ maximum interaural delays, sizes of their external ears, and widths of their heads.},

	abstract = {Human sound localization results primarily from the processing of binaural differences in sound level and arrival time for locations in the horizontal plane (azimuth) and of spectral shape cues generated by the head and pinnae for positions in the vertical plane (elevation). The latter mechanism incorporates two processing stages: a spectral-to-spatial mapping stage and a binaural weighting stage that determines the contribution of each ear to perceived elevation as function of sound azimuth. We demonstrated recently that binaural pinna molds virtually abolish the ability to localize sound-source elevation, but, after several weeks, subjects regained normal localization performance. It is not clear which processing stage underlies this remarkable plasticity, because the auditory system could have learned the new spectral cues separately for each ear (spatial-mapping adaptation) or for one ear only, while extending its contribution into the contralateral hemifield (binaural-weighting adaptation). To dissociate these possibilities, we applied a long-term monaural spectral perturbation in 13 subjects. Our results show that, in eight experiments, listeners learned to localize accurately with new spectral cues that differed substantially from those provided by their own ears. Interestingly, five subjects, whose spectral cues were not sufficiently perturbed, never yielded stable localization performance. Our findings indicate that the analysis of spectral cues may involve a correlation process between the sensory input and a stored spectral representation of the subject's ears and that learning acts predominantly at a spectral-to-spatial mapping level rather than at the level of binaural weighting.},
